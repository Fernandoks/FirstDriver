C Embedded Training Course - First bare metal drivers for STM32

  - APIs and Drivers for STM32F446RE
  - Uses the NUCLEO Board STM32F446RE
  - Available Drivers: GPIO, SPI, I2C, and UART
  
  
# Target
Cortex-M4 STM32F446RE, but the drivers can be easily converted to any other STM32 F4 family just correcting the memory mapping.
Compile usign arm-none-eabi-gcc 


## IDE
This project uses a STM32CubeIDE, which is a Eclipse based IDE. So any other Eclipse version is capable of convert the .project file. 

## Instructions

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/Fernandoks/FirstDriver.gitt`
2. Using STM32CubeIDE (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) and import the project
3. Compile using arm-none-eabi-gcc
